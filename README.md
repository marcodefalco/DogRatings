Wrangling multiple datasets from multiple data sources and combining them into one. The topic? Dogs!

1. A detailed report of the analysis is in the act_report files.

2. The actual code that allowed me to combine all the datasets together is in the Wrangle_act.ipynb file:
  - If you want to re use the code, you need to have your own consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token and access_secret
  - Of course, also check your directories, I might have changed some name so the code might not work right off the bat if 
  you do organize the folders differently.
3. I included the datasets for completeness purposes. Yours might differ depending what you plan to do.
4. The data (all the sources) is extremely dirty and untidy!! I just decided to address the most pressing issues, but there is still a lot to clean for those with time and will!
